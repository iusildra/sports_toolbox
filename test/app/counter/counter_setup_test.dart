- Test the initial state of the counter setup form (name, color)
- The the form validation (name is required)
- Test the color dropdown menu (only available colors are shown)
- Test the color dropdown menu (selected color is shown)
- Test the color dropdown menu (selecting a color updates the state)
- Test the name input field (updating the name updates the state)
- Test the submit button (submitting the form returns the updated athlete)
- Test the submit button (submitting the form closes the dialog)
- Test the cancel button (cancelling the form closes the dialog, without applying the changes)
