/* Tests ideas:
- Initial state of the counter setup form (name, color)
- Form validation
- Color dropdown menu (only available colors are shown)
- Athlete setup dialog
  - shows correct values
  - updates on change
  - closes when submit is pressed
  - closes when cancel is pressed or when clicking outside
  - scores are reset when submitting
- Penalty :
  - initial value of 0
  - "increment" buttons ask for penalty value
  - submitting the form updates the penalty value
  - score is not changed from penalty
  - penalty is appended to the "store"
